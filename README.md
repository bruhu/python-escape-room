## Repository Contents

### Project Files

- **`main.ipynb`**: The main Python script containing the complete game code. This file implements the game logic, allowing players to navigate through various rooms and face unique challenges.
- **`escape-room-structures.ipynb`**: A Jupyter Notebook file containing the main game structures and reusable logic.

### Game Features

- Utilizes Python data structures (dictionaries and lists) to represent game rooms, paths, and items.
- Implements flow control using conditional statements to define game logic and player choices.
- Contains functions for modular code organization, improving readability.
- Includes error handling techniques to manage user input and ensure a smooth gameplay experience.
- The game finishes with a clear winning condition, allowing players to escape to the outside.

### Documentation

- Well-documented code with comments and docstrings that explain functionality and usage.
- A comprehensive overview of the game's structure and logic is provided in the notebook.

## Getting Started

To play the game, simply run the **`final.py`** script in your terminal using the command **`python final.py`**. Alternatively, you can open the **`pyton-escape-room-final.ipynb`** file on Jupyter Notebook or Google Collab.Follow the on-screen instructions to navigate through the rooms and solve puzzles.
